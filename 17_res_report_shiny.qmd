# Result Report {#sec-shiny_result_report_shiny}

`mapashiny` offers a one-click feature to export and report your functional module analysis results through comprehensive report generation. These tools enable you to share findings as structured data files and professionally formatted reports.

::: callout-important
Prerequisites: Before generating reports, ensure you have completed your MAPA analysis workflow including:

-   Enrichment analysis: Described in [Chapter 12](12_enrichment_analysis_shiny.qmd)
-   Pathway similarity calculation: Described in [Chapter 13](13_pathway_similarity_shiny.qmd)
-   Optional: Optimal clustering parameters determination described in [Chapter 14](14_get_functional_modules_shiny.qmd)
-   Clustering: Described in [Chapter 14](14_get_functional_modules_shiny.qmd)
-   Optional: LLM interpretation in [Chapter 15](15_llm_interpretation_shiny.qmd)

The functions in this chapter work with the final `functional_module` object from your analysis.

## Overview

With a single click, you can generate comprehensive analysis report in a HTML file with various plots and tables.

## Step 1: Load Your Data

-   **Option 1: Continue from Previous Step**

    If you have completed datavisualization in the **current** session, your data will automatically be available for final report.

-   **Option 2: Upload Existing Results**

    You can also upload previously saved results:

    1.  **Click "Browse"** at the top of the left panel (of *Data Visualization function* page) **"Upload functional module (.rda)"** to upload your functional module file (.rda format)
    2.  **Select your file**
    3.  **Wait for validation** - the app will automatically detect the input type and prepare for final report.
    4.  **Switch back to *Results & Report* page**

## Step 2: Start Report Generation

With just one simple click, you report will be generated. This process is expected to take around 30 seconds.

## Step 3: Review the Report

The generated report automatically includes:

**Analysis Summary:**

-   `Parameters`: Overview of enrichment analysis parameters and results
-   `Object information`: Summary statistics for each database and analysis level, and processing timeline and method details

**Visualizations:**

-   Top enriched pathways bar charts
-   Database-specific module bar charts (if applicable)
-   Functional module bar charts with LLM names (if available)
-   Similarity networks for all analysis levels

**Data Tables:**

-   One of Enrichment results for functional modules or LLM interpretation results with confidence scores (if available)

## Step 4: Download the Report

You can also click **Download** to save the exact report shown in the right panel as an HTML file on your computer. The download will be a ZIP file—simply unzip it to access the HTML report and view its contents.

**Working with Downloaded HTML file**: The easiest way to save images embedded in the HTML file is to right-click on the image and select "Save image as…" (in Mac) to download it to your local device.

## Step 5: View Analysis Code

Click the **"Code"** button to see the exact R code that replicates your analysis:

-   **Code 1**: Shows `function()` function usage
-   **Code 2**: Shows `function()` function usage

This code can be copied and used in your own R scripts for reproducible analysis.

## Next Steps

With your results exported and reports generated, you now have comprehensive documentation of your functional module analysis. These outputs provide the foundation for:

-   **Collaboration**: Share HTML reports with colleagues for easy viewing and discussion
-   **Publication**: Use HTML reports and exported the figures for manuscript preparation
-   **Presentation**: Extract visualizations and key findings for presentations
