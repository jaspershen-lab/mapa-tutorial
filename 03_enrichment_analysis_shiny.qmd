# Enrichment Analysis

This chapter covers how to perform pathway enrichment analysis using the mapa Shiny application. The Shiny app provides an intuitive interface for running both **Over-Representation Analysis (ORA)** and **Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)** for genes, and ORA for metabolites across multiple databases.

::: callout-important
Prerequisites: Before running enrichment analysis, ensure you have successfully uploaded and processed your data using the **Upload Data** interface as described in the previous chapter. The processed data from the ID conversion step will automatically be available for enrichment analysis.

## Supported Databases and Analysis Types

The mapa Shiny app leverages the powerful enrichment functions from the [`clusterProfiler`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/clusterProfiler.html) package for pathway analysis:

::: panel-tabset
##### For Gene Data

| Database | Supported Organism | Keytype Options | Analysis Types |
|----|----|----|----|
| Gene Ontology (GO) | Any organism with OrgDb object ([organism annotation database package from Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___OrgDb) or OrgDb object retrieved from AnnotationHub) | `ENTREZID`, `SYMBOL`, `ENSEMBL`, `UNIPROT` | ORA, GSEA |
| KEGG | [All KEGG organisms](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/tables/br08606.html) | `kegg`, `ncbi-geneid`, `ncbi-proteinid`, `uniprot` | ORA, GSEA |

::: callout-tip
For comprehensive understanding of enrichment analysis concepts, methodologies, we highly recommend reading the [Biomedical Knowledge Mining using GOSemSim and clusterProfiler](https://yulab-smu.top/biomedical-knowledge-mining-book/index.html) book. This book covers all the underlying methods that mapa uses and will help you make informed decisions about your analysis parameters.

## Gene-based Enrichment Analysis

### Step 1: Select Analysis Type

The app automatically detects your data type (whether "gene" or "metabolite") from the previous step. For gene data, choose between:

-   **Pathway enrichment analysis (ORA)**: Tests for over-representation of your genes in predefined pathways
-   **Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)**: Analyzes the entire ranked gene list to identify enriched pathways

::: callout-note
**GSEA Requirements**: If you select GSEA, an additional "Order by" field will appear. This should correspond to a numeric column in your data (like fold change or p-values) that will be used to rank genes.

### Step 2: Configure Database Parameters

The app **automatically detects available databases** based on your organism and displays relevant parameter options:

## Metabolite-based Enrichment Analysis

For metabolite data, the interface automatically switches to metabolite-specific options and shows available databases based on your organism:

-   **Human**: Both HMDB and KEGG databases available
-   **Other organisms**: Only KEGG database available

## Understanding the Results

Key columns in enrichment results:

::: panel-tabset
##### Gene ORA

**Core Information:**

-   `ID`: Pathway identifier (e.g., GO:0042060 for GO, hsa04060 for KEGG, R-HSA-5669034 for Reactome)
-   `Description`: Pathway name
-   `ONTOLOGY`: Biological ontology (for GO only: MF=molecular function, CC=cellular component, BP=biological process)
-   `category`/`subcategory`: KEGG pathway categories (for KEGG only)

**Statistical Measures:**

-   `pvalue`: Raw p-value from hypergeometric test (equivalent to one-sided Fisher's exact test)
-   `p_adjust`: Adjusted p-value after multiple testing correction (BH method by default)
-   `qvalue`: Q-value for FDR control. For more information, see `?qvalue::qvalue`

**Gene Mapping:**

-   `GeneRatio`: Ratio of input genes annotated to this pathway (format: "genes_in_pathway/total_input_genes")
-   `BgRatio`: Ratio of all genes annotated to this pathway in the background universe (format: "pathway_genes/universe_genes")
-   `Count`: Total number of genes from input list that match this pathway
-   `geneID`: Gene IDs that overlap between your gene list and the pathway (separated by "/")

**Enrichment Metrics:**

-   `RichFactor`: Ratio of input genes annotated to a pathway vs. all genes annotated to this pathway
-   `FoldEnrichment`: Enrichment fold change (GeneRatio divided by BgRatio)
-   `zScore`: Standard deviations away from expected overlap (How unusual or extreme the observed enrichment is compared to what you'd expect by chance. Higher absolute z-score means more "surprising" or significant enrichment.)

##### GSEA

For GSEA results, additional columns specific to ranked list analysis include:

-   `setSize`: Total number of genes in the gene set/pathway
-   `enrichmentScore`: Degree of overrepresentation at top/bottom of ranked list
-   `NES`: **Normalized Enrichment Score - main metric for interpretation**
    -   Positive NES: pathway enriched in upregulated genes (pathway activation)
    -   Negative NES: pathway enriched in downregulated genes (pathway suppression)
-   `rank`: Position in ranked list where maximum enrichment score occurred
-   `leading_edge`: Statistics for the leading-edge subset of genes
-   `core_enrichment`: Core enriched genes that contribute most to the enrichment signal
-   `Count`: Number of core enriched genes

##### Metabolite ORA

For metabolite ORA results, the result structure differs from gene-based analysis:

**Pathway Information:**

-   `pathway_id`: KEGG pathway ID or [Small Molecule Pathway Database](https://smpdb.ca) pathway ID (e.g., SMP0000028)
-   `pathway_name`: Name of the metabolic pathway (e.g., "Caffeine Metabolism")
-   `describtion`: Detailed description of the pathway from the corresponding database
-   `pathway_class`: Classification of pathway (e.g., "Metabolic;primary_pathway", "Disease;primary_pathway")

**Statistical Measures:**

-   `p_value`: Raw p-value from enrichment test
-   `p_adjust`: Adjusted p-value for multiple testing correction

**Metabolite Mapping:**

-   `all_id`: All metabolite IDs in this pathway (separated by ";")
-   `all_number`: Total number of metabolites in the pathway
-   `mapped_id`: Your input metabolite IDs that map to this pathway (separated by ";")
-   `mapped_number`: Number of your metabolites that map to this pathway
-   `mapped_percentage`: Percentage of pathway metabolites covered by your input data

## Viewing the Analysis Code

Click the **"Code"** button to see the exact R code that replicates your analysis: This code can be copied and used in your own R scripts for reproducible analysis.

## Next Steps

Once your enrichment analysis is complete:

1.  **Review Results**: Examine the significance and biological relevance of enriched pathways

2.  **Download Data**: Save results (especially R Object from R Object tab) for further analysis

3.  **Proceed to Clustering**: Click the **"Next"** button to move to pathway clustering analysis. Based on your data type and analysis goals, you can proceed to:

    -   **SimCluster Method**: Traditional similarity-based clustering (Step 1: Merge Pathways)
    -   **EmbedCluster Method**: Advanced biotext embedding-based clustering

    For metabolite analyses in non-human organisms, the app will automatically direct you to the EmbedCluster method, as it's more suitable for single-database analyses.
