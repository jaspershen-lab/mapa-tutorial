## mapa: Functional Module Annotation for Pathway Analysis Results Using LLM

**MAPA** is a streamlined workflow for pathway-enrichment analysis and enrichment result interpretation that turns large omics datasets into clear biological insight. It is developed by the [Shen Lab at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore](https://www.shen-lab.org/). It:

1.  **Detects enriched pathways** from your data via over-representation analysis (ORA) or gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA).
2.  **Clusters overlapping or functional-related pathways** into functional modules, so every informative pathway—not just the "top 5 or 10"—contributes to the story.
3.  **Summarises each module with large-language models (LLM)** (e.g., ChatGPT), linking the results to the latest findings in literature from PubMed.

The outcome is a fast, reproducible, and user-friendly pipeline that reduces redundancy and delivers biologically meaningful interpretations for enrichment results.

## Aim of This Tutorial

This guide walks you through the two faces of mapa: the R package for command-line workflows and the Shiny app for point-and-click exploration. By the end, with your gene/metabolite list as input, you will be able to:

1.  Merge overlapping enriched pathways into informative functional modules.
2.  Generate biological interpretations of each module with large-language models.
3.  Create publication-ready visuals of enrichment results, module networks, and pathway–molecule relationships.
4.  Export a comprehensive report that gathers every table, figure, and LLM-based summary in one place.

Whether you favour the command line or a browser, the tutorial gives you everything you need to apply MAPA confidently in your bioinformatics projects.
