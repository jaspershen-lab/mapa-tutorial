# Data Visualization {#sec-shiny_data_visualization_shiny}

This chaper details on how to utilize comprehensive visualization functions to explore and present your pathway enrichment and functional module results. Four main visualization approaches are covered: pathway bar charts, module information plots, similarity networks, and relationship networks.

Prerequisites: Before creating visualizations, make sure you have completed the previous analysis steps. The visualization functions require objects from:

-   Enrichment analysis: [Chapter 12](12_enrichment_analysis_shiny.qmd)
-   Module clustering: [Chapter 13](13_pathway_similarity_shiny.qmd) and [Chapter 14](14_get_functional_modules_shiny.qmd)
-   Optional: LLM interpretation: [Chapter 15](15_llm_interpretation_shiny.qmd)

## Option 1: Pathway Bar Chart

## Option 2: Module Information Plot

## Option 3: Similarity Network

## Option 4: Relationship Network
