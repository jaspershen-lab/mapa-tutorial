# Installation {#sec-shinyapp_installation}

Follow the steps below to install the latest development version of **MAPA shinyapp** from GitHub (the script first installs *BiocManager*, *remotes*, and *MAPA* if you don’t have them):

```{r}
#| eval=FALSE

if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
 install.packages("BiocManager") 
}

if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
 install.packages("remotes") 
}

remotes::install_github(
  "jaspershen-lab/mapa",
  dependencies = TRUE,
  repos = BiocManager::repositories(),
  upgrade = "ask"
)

remotes::install_github(
  "jaspershen-lab/mapashiny",
  dependencies = TRUE,
  repos        = BiocManager::repositories(),
  upgrade      = "ask"
)

```

::: callout-note
**Possible Dependency Conflict:** If `mapa` installation failed because the `simplifyEnrichment` version is incompatible, update `Bioconductor` to **version 3.20 or newer**. To do that, you’ll need R environment **4.4.0 or newer**.

::: callout-tip
**What is MAPA shinyapp:** The Shiny-app version for MAPA lets you run the complete MAPA workflow with points and clicks without any R coding skills. It’s especially handy for bench scientists and those who prefer a graphical UI.

**How to Launch the Shiny App:**

1.  In an R session, run:`mapashiny::run_mapa_shiny()`

2.  An R viewer window will open where you can start the workflow. You can also use the *Open in Browser* button (top-right) to launch the app in your default web browser.

3.  You can stop the app at any time by closing the browser tab/window or pressing the stop button in your R IDE.

If you prefer not to run the mapa workflow locally on your computer, you can also access it through our web platform: https://mapashiny.jaspershenlab.com
